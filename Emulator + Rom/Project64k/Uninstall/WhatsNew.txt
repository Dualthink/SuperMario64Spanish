New/Updated in v1.4.01
------------------------

[English]		by Zilmar
[English alternative] 	by Smiff

That's it im afraid. All other translations are carried over from the last release. So all the new text isn't translated, but we figured it's better than nothing. It just wasn't possible to get new translations in before release, as I type this we've got 3 hours 'till release and it's been hectic like this for a while. Please feel free to update and distribute your own language files as you see fit - I won't be around to co-ordinate things.

I had to cut [English (original)] because I seem to have hit a .lng filesize limit (~64kb) (!) ... we'll need to extend this to get any more translations in. Don't worry, keep them coming, I'm sure Zilmar can do something about that :) So if you want the original text just delete the file for now.

Authors, if you would like your email removed from this list just ask - I am only giving email addresses where people put them in the file, otherwise I'll assume you wanted it kept private.
